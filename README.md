# Basic-Image-Processor
Code and supplementary files for my simple image processor.

This was originally a project for my CPE-462 Image Processing and Coding class at Stevens Tech.\
OpenCV must be installed in order to use this program, many of the functions used come from this.\
You can follow my [Project Report](CPE-462_Project_Report.pdf) for more details and how I usually ran the project, though there may be alternate methods depending on how your compiler settings are and what operating system you use.\
\
2 .json files from the .vscode folder were included to dictate certain directory references that worked for me.
